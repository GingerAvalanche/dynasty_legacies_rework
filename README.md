# Dynasty Legacies Rework

Dynasty Legacies are now about the “ideology” of your dynasty, as it progress towards renascence, establishing its own model of goverment.

An ideology is a set of beliefs or philosophies attributed to a person or group of persons, in which practical elements are as prominent as theoretical ones.

I love medieval history, and as i noticed that IA choses a single legacy type to maximize, i have the idea of correlating the vague concept of dynasty legacies with the different ideologies that were sprouting in the Middle ages. The ideology perks are all balanced not only for players, but also for the IA, and they will change AI behavior as like a new trait shared with all dynasty members!

*There are 5 levels of stackable buffs and nerfs!
*Players can chose any ideology.
*AI will tend to chose an ideology based on their government type.
*As the legacies are now much more impactfull, the level progress have been slowed!
